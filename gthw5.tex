\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{a}
Every bidder submits a concealed bid to the auctioneer who then awards the item for sale to the highest bidder. This bidder then pays a price equal to the third-highest bid submitted.
\subsection*{b \& c}
A good strategy consists in submitting the highest bid as long as the third-highest bid is still less or equal to your true valuation. Differently from the best strategy for the second-price auction playing optimally thus involves reasoning about the other players' behaviour.\\
Moreover, truth-telling is no longer incentivized as it was in the second-price auction and strategizing becomes now possible. To see this consider an auction with three bidders: $i,j$ and $h$ where the true valuations are such that $v_j>v_i>v_h$. Say, $j$ and $h$ submit truthful bids, so that $\hat{v_j}=v_j$ and $\hat{v_h}=v_h$. Then $i$ could profit from offering some bid $\hat{v_i}>\hat{v_j}>v_i$ and not just report her true valuation. Although $i$ is not playing truthfully, for $\hat{v_i}\neq v_i$, her utility will be $v_i-\hat{v_h}>0$, thus strictly larger than the payoff of zero she would have gotten for playing $\hat{v_i}=v_i$.\\
Therefore, a bidder's best bid depends on what the other players' true valuations are. This, in turn, implies that there is no dominant strategy.
\subsection*{d}
When trying to maximize their utility bidders can submit bids in such a way as to incur a cost. \\
Consider the following example. Suppose player $i$ anticipates mistakenly that her true valuation is higher than $h$'s and correcty that it is lower than $j$ - she believes: $(v_j>v_i>v_h)$ - and assumes that $h$ and $j$ will bid truthfully. Her last assumption is correct, they really do bid truthfully, however, $h$'s valuations is not as she believes. In reality the valuations are ordered $v_j>v_h>v_i$. Now, $i$ will play $\hat{v_{i}}>\hat{v_j}=v_j$ which indeed garantuees her the win. But since the bids are now $\hat{v_i}>\hat{v_j}=\hat{v_j}>hat{v_h}=v_h>v_i$, so the third-higest bid is now equal to $v_h$, she loses $v_h-v_i$ instead of winning the auction for a price below her valuation.\\
In such a situation it would be beneficial for $i$ as well as for $j$ to award the auctioned item to $j$ for a price $p=v_h$. This would cancel $i$'s loss, thus leaving her better off, and give $j$ a payoff of $v_j-v_h$ which is an increase from the $0$ she got before.\\
In brief, the third-price sealed bid auction is not Pareto efficient in the sense described.
\section*{Question 2}
We have to define the elements of the tuple $<N,\bm{A},\bm{\Theta},p,\bm{u}>$.
\begin{align*}
&N=\{1,2\} \\
&\bm{A}=A_1\times A_2, \text{ where $A_1=A_2=\mathbb{N}_{\geq 0}$}\text{. Note that I count only integers as bids.}\\
&\bm{\Theta}=\Theta_1 \times \Theta_2, \text{ where $\Theta_1=\Theta_2= \mathbb{N}\cap [101,200]$}\\
&p: \bm{\Theta} \rightarrow [0,1] \text{ is a constant function assigning $p(\theta)=\tfrac{1}{|\bm{\Theta}|}$ to all $\theta \in \bm{\Theta}$}\\
&\bm{u}=(u_1,u_2)\\
&u_1:\bm{A}\times \bm{\Theta} \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\text{ eg. $((a_1,a_2),(\theta_1, \theta_2))\rightarrow r\in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$}\\
&\text{Concretely, with strict ordering of bidders' offers (no ties):}\\
&\text{For some action profile $(a_1,a_2)\in\bm{A}$ and some type profile $(\theta_1,\theta_2)\in \bm{\Theta}$,}\\
&u_1=\begin{cases}
\text{if } a_1>a_2 \text{ then }\theta_1-a_1 \\
\text{otherwise } 0
\end{cases}\\
&u_2=\begin{cases}
\text{if } a_2>a_1 \text{ then }\theta_2-a_2 \\
\text{otherwise } 0
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Finding a Bayes-Nash-Equilibrium (BNE)}\\
There is a Bayes-Nash-Equilibrium in the pure strategy profile $\bm{s}=(s_1,s_2)$ where both bidders bid according to strategy $s_i: a_i=\tfrac{\theta_i}{2}+50$, where $\theta_i$ denotes bidder $i$'s true valuation and $a_i$ her bid.\\
To see that this is indeed a BNE consider Bidder 1's position. I want to show that in $\bm{s}$ her best strategy is $s_1$, given that the other bidder plays $s_2$. Because both players play 
analogously, this then forms a stable strategy profile where nobody wants to deviate unilaterally.\\
Bidder 1's utility $u_i$ is equal to $0$ if $a_1<a_2$, where $a_2$ is the other bidder's offer, and equal to $\theta_1-a_1$ if $a_1\geq a_2$ (\textbf{assume that ties are broken in first 
bidder's favour}). So Bidder 1's expected utility when observing type $\theta_1$ and submitting bid $a_1$ is equal to the probability of winning with $a_1$ times the difference between her 
bid and her valuation: $EU_1(a_1)=P(win|a_1)\times (\theta_1-a_1)$. Now, what about the probability of winning with some bid, given that the other bidder plays according to $s_2$?\\
$P(win|a_1, s_2):\\
\begin{cases}
\text{if } a_1>150\text{, then }P(win|a_1,s_2)=1\\
\text{if } a_1\leq 150\text{, then }P(win|a_1,s_2)=0\\
\text{if } 101\leq a_1\geq 150\text{, then }P(win|a_1,s_2)=\tfrac{1}{50}*(x-100)\\
\end{cases} $
To find the optimal bid, Bidder 1 thus maximizes the expression $\tfrac{1}{50}*(a_1-100)*(\theta_1-a_1)$ for $a_1$. This yields an optimal bid $a_1^*$, given some type $\theta_1$, of $a_1^*=\tfrac{\theta_1}{2}+50$.\\

\section*{3}
The mechanism described is not incentive-compatible. To see this consider the following auction with $n=4$ and $k=3$. The first table represents a situation where all bidders submit thruthful bids. Compare it with the second table where all the valuations remain as before and Bidder $1$ obtains an advantage by submitting a false valuation. She manages to improve her payoff from $0$ to $5$. This goes to show that bidding thruthfully is not a dominant strategy.
