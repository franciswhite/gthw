\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{a}
First, note that given some strategy profile $\boldsymbol{s}$ $u'_i(\boldsymbol{s})$ differs from $u_i(\boldsymbol{s})$ always by $\tfrac{c}{2}$.
\begin{align*}
u'_i(\boldsymbol{s})=&\sum_{\boldsymbol{a}\in \boldsymbol{A}}[u_i(\boldsymbol{a})-\tfrac{c}{2})*\Pi_{j\in N} s_j(a_j)] \\
=&\sum_{\boldsymbol{a}\in \boldsymbol{A}}[u_i(\boldsymbol{a} *\Pi_{j\in N} s_j(a_j)] - \sum_{\boldsymbol{a}\in \boldsymbol{A}}[\tfrac{c}{2} *\Pi_{j\in N} s_j(a_j )] \\
=& u_i(\boldsymbol{s})-\tfrac{c}{2}*1 \\
u'_i(\boldsymbol{s})=& u_i(\boldsymbol{s})-\tfrac{c}{2} \\
\end{align*}
Now, suppose there is a NE in some $\boldsymbol{s}$, because for both $i=1,2$ we have that $u_{i}(\boldsymbol{s})$ is greater or equal to $u_i(s_i,\boldsymbol{s}_{-1})$ for any $s_i$.\\
 By what we showed above we know that $u_{i}(\boldsymbol{s}) - \tfrac{c}{2}=u'_{i}(\boldsymbol{s})$ and that $u_i(s_i, \boldsymbol{s}_{-i}) - \tfrac{c}{2}=u'_{i}(s_i,\boldsymbol{s}_{-i})$, for any $s_i$.\\
So any NE in the original game will also be a NE in the corresponding zero-sum game. 
\subsection*{b}
Consider the following two games - on the left the original and on the right its transformation.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[l]{|l|l|l|}
\hline
          & $L$ & $R$  \\ \hline
$T$     & $10,0$   & $5,5$ \\ \hline
$B$		& $0,10$	& $8,2$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\quad
\begin{tabular}[r]{|l|l|l|}
\hline
          & $L$ & $R$  \\ \hline
$T$     & $5,-5$   & $0,0$ \\ \hline
$B$		& $-5,5$	& $3,-3$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent Say the players in these two-player, constant-sum games choose their strategy according to the following rules.

 \fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%
    If only one of the two actions is garantueed to yield a non-negative payof, then play that action. If both or none can yield a negative payoff, mix equally between the two.
    }%
   }

\noindent Using this as a solution concept would give us the mixed strategies $((0.5,0.5),(0.5,0.5))$ in the original game, but $((1,0),(0.5,0.5))$ in the transformed game.

\section*{Question 3}
This Bayesian game can be formally represented as a tuple $<N,\boldsymbol{A}, \Theta, P, u>$. There are two players $N=\{1,2\}$, two actions available to each so that the set of action profiles is $\boldsymbol{A}=\{(T,L),(T,R),(B,L),(B,R)\}$. The players' type encapsulates which of two possible games they are playing. Rowena is certain about which game it is while Colin is not. We model this by letting Rowena observe one of her two types which tells her which game is going to be played before the game. Colin has only one type and can thus not distinguish between the games before choosing an action according to some strategy. So $\Theta_1=\{\star, two\}$, $\Theta_2=\{\star\}$. Thus $\Theta=\{(zero,\star),(two,\star)\}$ and $p: \Theta \rightarrow \{0.5\}$. Finally, the utility function can be given most easily in two tables - one for the type profile $(zero,\star)$ and the other for $(two,\star)$.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[l]{|l|l|l|}
\hline
          & $L$ & $R$  \\ \hline
$T$     & 5,5   & 0,10 \\ \hline
$B$		& 10,0	& 1,1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\quad
\begin{tabular}[r]{|l|l|l|}
\hline
          & $L$ & $R$  \\ \hline
$T$     & 5,5   & 2,10 \\ \hline
$B$		& 10,2	& 1,1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Since Rowena will know which game is played, she can make conditional plans for either case. Her available pure strategies are then $S_1=\{AB,AT,Bi0-Ti2,Ti0,Bi2\}$, or in beautiful prose: Play always bottom, Play always top, Play bottom in case $\alpha=0$ and top in case $\alpha=2$, Play bottom in case $\alpha=2$ and top in case $\alpha=0$. Colin, however, does not have the luxury of conditionalizing his actions on the type profile. His only two pure strategies are $S_2=\{L,R\}$. Given these individual strategy sets, we can represent the pure strategy space by means of a $4\times 2$ matrix. The boxes contain the players' expected payoffs associated with a given pure strategy profile. To provide an example, Colin's expected payoff of $3.5$ in the strategy profile $(Bi2-Ti0,L)$ is the result of him winning $5$ when the $\alpha=0$-game is played - because then Rowena plays $T$, according to her conditional strategy - and him winning $2$ when the $\alpha=2$-game is played - because then Rowena's contingency plan then foresees playing $B$. Each game being equiprobable with probability $0.5$ this yields an expected utility of $0.5*5+0.5*2=3.5$.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[l]{|l|l|l|}
\hline
          & $L$ & $R$  \\ \hline
$AB$     & 10, 1   & 1, 1 \\ \hline
$AT$		& 5, 5	& 1, 10 \\ \hline
$Bi2-Ti0$	& 7.5, 3.5 & 0.5, 5.5 \\ \hline
$Bi0-Ti2$	& 7.5, 2.5	& 1.5, 5.5 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

$Bi0-Ti2$ strictly dominates $AT$ for Rowena, so we can eliminate it. This leads to a simplified matrix where we can clearly see two pure NE: $(AB,L)$ and $(Bi0-Ti2,R)$.

\hline
          & $L$ & $R$  \\ \hline
$AB$     & 10, 1   & 1, 1 \\ \hline
$Bi2-Ti0$	& 7.5, 3.5 & 0.5, 5.5 \\ \hline
$Bi0-Ti2$	& 7.5, 2.5	& 1.5, 5.5 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

I colaborated with Max Rapp on the programming question.
